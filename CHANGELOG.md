## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-13

### 🎉 Initial Release

#### Core Engine
- Entity Component System with transform, material, rigidbody, collider, and script components
- Real-time 3D viewport with Three.js rendering, shadows, and PBR materials
- Scene save/load system using JSON serialization
- Play/Stop mode with automatic scene state snapshot and restore
- 6 primitive mesh types: cube, sphere, cylinder, plane, cone, torus

#### Physics Engine
- Custom physics simulation with gravity, mass, drag, and restitution
- AABB broadphase + SAT narrowphase collision detection
- Impulse-based collision resolution with friction
- Box, sphere, and capsule collider shapes
- Physics material system (friction, bounciness, density)
- Debug visualization for colliders, velocity vectors, and contact points

#### Lua Scripting
- Built-in Lua-to-JavaScript transpiler with entity API bindings
- Entity control: position, rotation, scale access from scripts
- Input API: GetKey, GetKeyDown, GetKeyUp, GetMouseButton, GetMouseX/Y
- Lifecycle functions: Start() and Update() per entity
- Persistent state between frames via _state table
- 12 preset scripts for common gameplay patterns
- Live script editor with syntax highlighting and error display

#### Time-Travel Debugging
- Automatic frame-by-frame state recording during play mode
- Timeline scrubber with drag-to-rewind interface
- Delta compression with configurable keyframe intervals (3-30× compression ratio)

- Frame Inspector panel showing per-entity state at any recorded frame
- Frame Comparison mode to diff two frames side by side
- Waveform minimap showing activity, contacts, and energy over time
- Bookmarkable frames and timeline branching

#### Parallel Reality Testing
- Run 2-4 simultaneous simulation copies with different parameters
- Split viewport rendering for side-by-side comparison
- Preset parameter variations (gravity, friction, time scale)
- Divergence detection between realities

#### Editor UI
