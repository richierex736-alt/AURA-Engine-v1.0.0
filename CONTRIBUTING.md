## 🎨 Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript — no `any` unless absolutely necessary
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused — one responsibility per component
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

### CSS
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for theming
- Follow BEM-like naming: `.kv-panel`, `.kv-panel-header`
- Keep styles in `index.css` (single stylesheet)

### File Naming
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `Hierarchy.tsx`)
- Engine modules: `camelCase.ts` (e.g., `physics.ts`)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
